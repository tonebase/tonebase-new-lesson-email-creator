# The tonebase Digest Creator - 2019

### What is it?

A quick way to create the Piano digest for weekly sending to the Piano subscribers. Eventually we will want to move the Guitar Digest to this format too as it is a little more extensible! This is a way easier and more extensible version than the app we used before and can easily be used to go between instruments.

### How to use?

Follow the following directions:

```
1. Clone this repo. => git clone https://github.com/tonebase/tonebase-Digest-Creator
2. Make edits to DigestData.json as needed
3. Drop the index.html into the browser of your choice - Chrome is recommended
4. Wait 4-5 seconds - a new tab will open with the HTML data
```

This will do everything for you in terms of preview + generating HTML. Scheduling, batching and sending is another animal and we have other guides (or will have other guides) for that!
