# New Lesson Email Creator

### What is it?

An INSANELY easy way to create new lesson emails. Simply clone this repo., edit the script file to include the slug of the lesson and wah-la, instamagic, you got the new lesson email. Thank me later ;)

### How to use?

Follow the following directions:

```
1. Clone this repo. => git clone https://github.com/tonebase/tonebase-new-lesson-email-creator
2. Navigate to the folder you cloned down via Terminal and hit start8000 or python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8000
4. Answer the prompts and that's about it...
5. Make sure everything looks good, then type 'yes' to the show HTML prompt

This will do everything for you in terms of preview + generating HTML. Scheduling, batching and sending is another animal and we have other guides (or will have other guides) for that!
