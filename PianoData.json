        "My name is Chris, and I’m a classical guitarist and one of the founders of tonebase. By now, you should have met Ben, the pianist, director, and classical music buff leading the development of this brand-new (and rapidly growing) community of classical pianists.",
        "So why am I – a classical guitarist – writing the first Piano Digest note? Well, to put it frankly… Ben’s a little busy right now. At this moment, he’s on his third of 18 (😱) production days we have scheduled over the next three weeks! That’s a total of 12 new artists teaching for tonebase Piano including John O’Conor, Simone Dinnerstein, Ursula Oppens, and more. He’ll have a moment next week to share updates on how his trip is going – but for now, you’re stuck with me!",
        "Aside from providing updates on newly produced lessons, the other purpose of these emails is to get to know all of you! We’d love to learn a little bit about your personal journey with the piano as well as who or what you’d like to see taught on tonebase in the future. Just hit “Reply” and let us know.",
        "Anyway, that’s all from me for now – enjoy the lesson previews and sneak peaks below!"
