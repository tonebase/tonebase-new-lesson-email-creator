        "It’s been another exciting week here at tonebase HQ. We’re proud (and frankly relieved) to announce that Nightingale is now LIVE! You heard me right – it’s really there. Check it out for yourself: tonebase.co We really appreciate your patience and want to thank you for hanging in there as we – well, let’s be honest, Abhi – overcame one technical roadblock after another. However, we’re quite proud of the result as well as all the new content that accompanies it, so please check it out and let us know what you think.",
        "Hot on the tail of Nightingale, we’ll be rolling out some new features in the next couple weeks. One of the features (which I alluded to last week) is called “Workouts” and does exactly what it sounds like! It’s already built and in the testing process, and we can’t wait to get it out to all of you.",
        "From the content team, we’ve got a couple of great lessons coming out next week. The first is taught by the prolific Emmanuel Sowicz whose performance of Scarlatti you definitely need to check out if you haven’t already. He’ll be teaching a lesson he’s calling “Musical Grammar” that breaks down the often complicated customs of classical music and shows you how to apply them to a musical score. Then, later in the week, we’ll be sharing a lesson from the Montenegrin Duo (we’re kind of on a duo kick right now), so stay tuned for that as well!",
        "That’s all from us for now. For those of you in America, enjoy the long Labor Day weekend. And for everyone else… enjoy your regularly scheduled weekend as well!"
